# MTG-twitter-bot
a python based project utilizing Google Cloud Scheduler to daily post an API extracted trading card to Twitter.
this project was able to post images to twitter before image posting was officially available on twitter api v2. 
this project also filtered out over-duplicated and atypical format cards, as well as combining multi-image cards into a single image.

*while this project was deployed and fully functional, I elected to remove it from twitter due to discontentment with the platform*
